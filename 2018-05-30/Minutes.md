# Tango Kernel Follow-up Meeting - 2018/05/30

Held on 2018/05/30 at 16:00 CET on https://appear.in/tango-kernel

Participants: Reynald Bourtembourg, Andrew Goetz, Jean-Michel Chaize (ESRF)
              Igor Khokhriakov (IK), Sergi Rubio (ALBA)

# Minutes
## 1. New Github repository to archive the Tango kernel meeting minutes: https://github.com/tango-controls/tango-kernel-followup

Everyone agreed to use github for minutes

## 2. cppTango 9.3.0 and 9.3.1 pre-release status and issues.

Reynald asked if any sites still have a large number of V7 device servers and clients. ALBA is still using V7 for most device servers running on Suse 11. They tried V9 and could compile the C++ kernel but there was a problem with PyTango V9. In order to upgrade they need to upgrade the hardware

It would help ALBA if the zmq port for sending events from a device server could be fixed. ALBA will make a feature request for this.

## 3. Tango Meeting preparation
## 4. Go through the main issues and define priorities
## 5. AOB (JTango?, PyTango?, ...?)
